About this Visualization - for CS498 Project
<p>
This visualization is an exploration of the health of Illinois' downstate municipal pension funds.
The data comes from a publicly available report from the Illinois Department of Insurance. This contains
many metrics about each fund's assets, liabilitlies, and health. 

Utilizing this data, which was transformed and structured to feed into the d3 graphs, we are able to
tell a narrative story about how the performance of Illinois' pension funds are doing.

This website was built using only html, css, and javascript. No templates were used.

<p>
The structure of this visualization closely follows the martini glass narrative structure. 
We start by giving an overview of the context of the problem. The first scene in this visualization is given
by the context descriptions, and then a line chart and bar chart.
This scene gives an overview of what the data contains, and also at a macro scale, the funding of the entire state of Illinois.
The line graph on the left in this scene compares the parameters assets and liabilities by year. 
<br>The y-axis goes from 0
to the maximum of either the assets or liabilities. Starting at 0 gives a visual context as to how far apart 
the assets and liabilities truly are. Tick-marks are shown to point to a few different dollar amounts, and gridlines follow
these tick marks so a viewer can easily infer what the data values are.
The x-axis contains 4 tickmarks for the 4 years of data in this graph, with gridlines as well.
<br> The lines and circles
on this graph are colored red and green to represent assets and liabilities, with a legend annotation in the bottom
right to show this relationship. Circles were added at the data points to emphasize where the actual data lies.
The line is nice since it reminds the viewer that this is data changing over time, but there are only 4 actual data points,
so the circles  highlight that.
There is also an annotation pointing to the last value of liabilities. This annotation answers the question posed
in the context description of "How much does Illinois owe?" It is an important big picture number, and without 
overwhelming the viewer with numbers and annotations, adds a lot of context to this graph. 
</p>

<p>
To the right of the line chart in this scene is a bar chart. This uses the parameters year and funding ratio zone.
This section gives the viewer additional information on how to judge if a fund has enough assets compared to its liabilities.
The bar chart shows the distribution of the given funding ratio zones to highlight the problem at hand. The bar chart
is a good way to display the distribution since the area of each rectangle is proportional to the percent in each category.
An annotation is also added to this graph, above each rectangle, showing the data value for each category.
Without overcrowding with information, this lets the viewer more precisely compare the exact values for each category
without having to guess based off how large the bars are.
<br>
A trigger is also present in this scene, where the viewer and change the year selection and the bar chart updates accordingly.
This lets the viewer explore to see how the distribution of funding zones is changing over time. They can decide for themselves
is it getting better or is it getting worse.
This is a turning point in the martini glass structure where we are transitioning from data overview and story
to user exploration.
<br>
Below both the line chart and bar chart is a trigger button to move to the next scene.

<p>
Once a viewer clicks a button to move to the second scene, the graph objects change slightly, but enough
visual consistency is kept as to not disorientate the viewer. In this section, a viewer can select any
of the hundreds of funds and explore the data themselves. The line graph on the left maintains visual consistency in its
structure. The parameters are kept the same, being assets, liabilities, and year, however it is now drilled down
to contain only the data for the selected fund in the drop down. A viewer can change the selected fund in the drop down
to trigger a change in the values displayed in this entire scene. Some of the paragraphs dissapeared now to reduce clutter. 
Since this scene is dedicated to exploration, I wanted to remove that extra information that belonged to the first scene,
which was dedicated to telling an overview and context of the data.
<br>
The axes and legend annotation are kept on the line graph for consistency. The annotation pointing out the 2016
liabilities number is removed. On the first graph, since we were giving an overview of the data,
that was a good way to provide one big key number to understand the data as a whole. Now that the viewer understands the data
and is exploring on their own, it seemed fitting to remove this annotation.
<br>
The right portion of the scene now changes to highlight a key value for a particular fund - its funding ratio.
Even though the same exact bar chart isn't kept, visual consistency is maintained in that this space of the visualization
provides information on the funding ratio. The color of the key funding ratio value changes according to what
zone it is in as provided in the overview scene. The parameters in this portion are the assets and liabilities and the
selected fund name. The funding ratio for the most recent year is highlighted in this annotation, as having all 4 values
could be overwhelming.

<p>
There is then a trigger button again to go back to the overview of the data and re-load scene 1.
